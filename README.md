# nanodegree-android-0-app-portfolio
First app project for Udacitys Android Developer Nanodegree curriculum.

##The goals of this project are:
- For you to build an app layout that showcases the apps you will build across your Nanodegree journey.
- To introduce you to the process of submitting a project for review. You will be expected to submit projects for review throughout the program, so it's important that you go through the process early.
- To familiarize you with the experience of receiving feedback on your work from Udacity reviewers. Sharing and receiving feedback on your code is a key part of the Nanodegree program.
